# Angular single-page application using MSAL Angular v1 on Azure AD

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL Angular v2](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular).

Check it out: [Angular single-page application secured with MSAL Angular v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-angular/tree/master), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
